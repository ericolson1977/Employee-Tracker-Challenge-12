## Description
With the goal of being able to view and manage the departments, roles, and employees of a potential company, I created a command line Content Management System (CMS). On opening the app via the terminal, the user is presenting with a list of options. The user will then be able to view all department, all job roles with corresponding information and employees with corresponding information. Further, the user will be able to add a department, add a job role and add an employee. Finally, the user will be able to update and existing employee with a new job role.
